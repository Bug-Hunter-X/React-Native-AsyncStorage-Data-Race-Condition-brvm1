This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications involving the use of AsyncStorage. The bug occurs due to a race condition where components attempt to access data from AsyncStorage before the asynchronous retrieval operation completes.  The solution illustrates safe practices for handling asynchronous operations with AsyncStorage, preventing crashes and ensuring data consistency.
